**Purpose**
A clear and concise description of what the PR is aiming to achieve. Commit messages explain
what you did, and the diff shows us how, but a description on your goal provides context for
reviewers.

While we expect new features to have some degree of prior discussion, bug fixes are fine to
submit as-is. If there is a discussion, we appreciate links here to simplify tracking it down.

**New Features**
Have you discussed this in Discussions or an Issue? Please provide a link if so.

**Bug Fixes**
Has the bug been reported in an Issue? Please provide a link if so.

**Before/After**
If this PR changes output, please post a short comparison for review.

**Additional Context**
Add any other context or notable details about the PR here.
